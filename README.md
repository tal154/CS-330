**How do I approach designing software?

My approach is to make my software do the most with the least effort. To do so, my software needs to be able to be encapsulate different functions and call them when it needs to be used.

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

My new design skills I learned for this project is to create different .ccp files to be able to do different tasks. I may have learned that before, but being able do so for creating the parts to make the mesh for the shapes was new to me.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?

My process was to make the different shapes through only having one vector of vertices and indicies and then calling the vectors multiple times in order to reduce the size of the vectors needed to be used. For example, creating a vector with 20 indices and calling 5 times vs creating a vector with 100 indices and calling 1 time. The margin for error is much higher for the 100 indices and harder to find where the errors are.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The encapsulation I used for the different functions is what I will bring to future work.

**How do I approach developing programs?

I use OOP in order to make my programs more repeatable and easy to understand for people who are new to it. 

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I took the vector out of the create mesh function and made it a seperate header and cpp files to reduce the confusion and clutter of the source file.

**How did iteration factor into your development?

I created mulitple small vectors and called them multiple times instead of creating one giant vector and calling once.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach did not change much while working on this project.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

My goal is to have a stable career that I enjoy doing. I previously earned a B.S. in Mathematics and I never felt like what I was doing was meaningful or fun. 

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I do not plan on using graphic or visuualization moving forward, but now knowing how to apply mouse controls into programs is something that I can use in being able to manipulate other prehiphreals, such as game controlers for camera control.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I do not plan on using graphic or visuualization moving forward, but if my job requires me to creatinga 3D rendering of a design, having the prior knowledge allows me to not have to start from square one.
